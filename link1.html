<h1>My First Link</h1>
<p>
	Here are some cool things which I use:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>st</strong> - the suckless (or simple) terminal. Patches I use for it are scrollback, alpha (alongside compton) and clipboard. Might add stuff later if i see the need to. </li>
	<li> <strong>ranger</strong> - a file manager. I've looked at others, but I've not seen the need to as stuff just seems to work with ranger + it's got image previews with an addon. </li>
	<li>third</li>
</ul>
