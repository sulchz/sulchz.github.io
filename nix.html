<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
	I'd been interested in tech and software for a while, and had some fun in school doing stuff with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey (Windows only)</a>. I got into Linux late 2018, on Manjaro, largely due to wanting to 'rice'. At some point I'll be adding pictures of stuff I made, some of which I'm quite proud of :p.

	I started off on i3wm, which I still reccomend to people new to tiling window managers simply due to how popular it is and the on-the-fly recompiling, it's a lot simpler to use than stuff like DWM which is what I'm on now. Again, at some point I need to point to the current configs which I use. Feel free to use them/edit them if you'd like.
</p>
<p>
	Anyways, after Manjaro I spent a lot of time bouncing around various distros; I had several spare PCs at the time and no shortage of time. My reccomendations now are (in no particular order):
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong> <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">Arch Linux</a> </strong> - If you're willing to tinker around with stuff it's great simply due to how good the wiki is. Also, pacman is one of the better package managers I've used; the AUR is amazing as well (and probably the only thing keeping me here haha).</li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://voidlinux.org/download/">Void Linux</a> </strong> - Another really nice bleeding-edge distro, with a very nice package manager. There were some schenanigans regarding the bus-factor with it a while back but it seems to have been resolved. It uses musl and runit as well, vs glibc and systemd, if that makes a difference.</li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">Debian (netinst)</a> </strong> - My go-to for a minimal, easy to use install on a system that I don't/can't run bleeding edge. I don't really see the point of running some downstream variant, particularly when you can build as light of a system from scratch, and will probably have a rant about this at some point (!!!). </li>
</ul>
I have also spent a fair bit of time exploring some more obscure stuff. Here are some nice projects worth looking at:
<ul>
	<li><strong> <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/">Plan 9</a> </strong> - A cool little project from Bell Labs, or rather set of projects as there are several forks. Not to be really used as a daily driver (unless you're into that, I suppose) but a cool project in terms of what it accomplishes/aimed to.</li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://k1ss.org/">KISS Linux</a> </strong> - A project started by Dylan Araps, who you may know for neofetch, pywal, or the Pure Bash Bible (the last of which is worth checking out for anyone interested in shellscript).</li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://www.adelielinux.org/">Adélie Linux</a> </strong> - Another smallish project, but not rolling release. It's aiming to be fully POSIX-compliant as well which is pretty cool. It shares some ideas with Alpine w.r.t. the package manager, but I much prefer the 'standard' implementation that Adélie goes with (though Alpine is worth checking out as well, of course)</li>
</ul>
