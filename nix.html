<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
	I'd been interested in tech and software for a while, and had some fun in school doing stuff with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">autohotkey (Windows only)</a>. I got into linux late 2018, on Manjaro, largely due to wanting to rice. At some point I'll be adding pictures of stuff I made, some of which I'm quite proud of :p. I started off on i3wm, which I still reccomend to people new to tiling window managers simply due to how popular it is and the on-the-fly recompiling, it's a lot simpler to use than stuff like DWM which is what I'm on now.

	After that I spent a few months

<ul>
	<li><strong>st</strong> - the suckless (or simple) terminal. Patches I use for it are scrollback, alpha (alongside compton) and clipboard. Might add stuff later if i see the need to. </li>
	<li>third</li>
</ul>
