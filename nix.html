<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
	I'd been interested in tech and software for a while, and had some fun in school doing stuff with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey (Windows only)</a>. I got into Linux late 2018, on Manjaro, largely due to wanting to 'rice'. At some point I'll be adding pictures of stuff I made, some of which I'm quite proud of :p.

	I started off on i3wm, which I still reccomend to people new to tiling window managers simply due to how popular it is and the on-the-fly recompiling, it's a lot simpler to use than stuff like DWM which is what I'm on now. Again, at some point I need to point to the current configs which I use. Feel free to use them/edit them if you'd like.
</p>
<p>
	Anyways, after Manjaro I spent a lot of time bouncing around various distros; I had several spare PCs at the time and no shortage of time. My reccomendations now are (in no particular order):
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong> <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">Arch Linux</a> </strong> - has somewhat of a negative repuation within the community for being elitist, and from experience it's one that's well deserved. Still, if you're willing to tinker around with stuff it's great simply due to how good the wiki is. Also, the AUR is amazing, probably the only thing keeping me on it at this point.</li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://voidlinux.org/download/">Void Linux</a> </strong> - Another really nice bleeding-edge distro, with a very nice package manager. There were some schenanigans regarding the bus-factor with it a while back but it seems to have been resolved. The ISOs are a bit outdated as of today (14-01-21) but the repos are fresh. Also, the community is somewhat more welcoming for what is in effect a very similar distro. </li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">Debian (netinst)</a> </strong> - My go-to for a minimal, easy to use install on a system that I don't/can't run bleeding edge. I don't really see the point of running some downstream variant, particularly when you can build as light of a system from scratch. </li>
</ul>
I have also spent a fair bit of time exploring some more obscure stuff. Here are some nice projects worth looking at:
<ul>
	<li><strong> <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/">Plan 9</a> </strong> - A cool little project from Bell Labs. Not to be really used as a daily driver (unless you're into that, I suppose) but a cool project in terms of what it accomplishes/aimed to.</li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://k1ss.org/">KISS Linux</a> </strong> - A project started by Dylan Araps, who you may know for neofetch, pywal, or the Pure Bash Bible (the last of which is a very worth checking out for anyone interested in shellscript). I might be throwing my biases into this one, but I like how 'clean' and small it is. </li>
	<li> <strong> <a href="https://www.adelielinux.org/">Adélie Linux</a> </strong> - Another smallish project, but not rolling release. It's aiming to be fully POSIX-compliant as well which is pretty cool. It shares some ideas with Alpine w.r.t. the package manager, but I much prefer the 'standard' implementation that Adélie goes with (though Alpine is worth checking out as well, of course)</li>
</ul>
