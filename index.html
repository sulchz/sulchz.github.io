    <p>This site is just bits and bobs about me which I think might be useful for others. Currently a second year physics undergrad, but am interested in educational access work and FLOSS as well.</p>
<h3>
	Current Musings
</h3>
    <p>Right now the site is basically an experiment with HTML and CSS. I've done some stuff with the <a href="https://openpotd.github.io/">OpenPOTD</a> website, which motivated me to do some stuff on this site which had been lying dormant for a while (oops!). Even so, expect the site to be very spartan.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
