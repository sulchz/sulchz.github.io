The first issue encountered was dealing with the imaginary and real parts seperately; in fact I did not think to do so initially and was had initially attempted to seperate them after performing the fourier transform. 

Another issue encountered was shifting the array such that the 'centre' of the function is at cell number 250 - though this was done easily enough. This did present some initial confusion as I was concerned about the shape of the plot - as it was not at all what I expected.
